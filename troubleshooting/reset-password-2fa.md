# Reset password / 2FA

To reset your password or 2FA, go through the following steps:

1. Open the `config.js` file in your Gunbot folder with a text editor like Notepad++ 
2. Scroll to the "GUI" section on the bottom of the file
3. Change the value for either `login` \(for password\) or for `twoFA` \(for 2FA\) to false.
4. Save the file and start and access Gunbot again, you will be able to setup a new password or 2FA code from there.
