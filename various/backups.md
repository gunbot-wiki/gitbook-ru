# Backups

Each time you apply saved settings, a copy of the previously working `config.js` file is backed up.

Backups are automatically saved in the /backups folder within your Gunbot folder.

## Restore a backup

To restore a backup, follow these steps:

1. Open the desired backup config file with a text editor like Notepad++.
2. Select and copy everything in the document.
3. Open the main `config.js` file with a text editor like Notepad++.
4. Replace the complete contents of this file with the copied contents of the backup file.
