# Acronyms

When people talk about Gunbot, they use a lot of Acronyms and other strange terms because it's easier than repeating the full parameter names over and over again.

These are some of the common ones.

* **MVTS** - Refers to the parameter MIN\_VOLUME\_TO\_SELL
* **MVTB** - Refers to the parameter MIN\_VOLUME\_TO\_BUY
* **TL** - Refers to the parameter  TRADING\_LIMIT
* **ITB** - Refers to the parameter IGNORE\_TRADES\_BEFORE
* **JSON** - JavaScript Object Notation which is the format in which gunbots config, and other core files are in. If someone is asking "to see your jsons", they are more than likely referring to the file which should be named exchange-BASE\_QUOTE-state.json, located in your gunbot executable location, after the pair has been cycled at least once.
* **DU** - Double up is a bag management strategy
* **TTO** - Refers to the parameter TSSL\_TARGET\_ONLY
* **RT** - Reversal Trading, which is another bag management strategy
* **RTSB** - Refers to the parameter RT\_SELL\_BUYDOWN
* **RTBB** - Refers to the parameter RT\_BUY\_BUYDOWN
* **BEP** - Break-even point - a different name for average bought price.
