# Strategy configurator

A strategy in Gunbot is a collection of settings that can be assigned to one or more trading pairs. These pairs will then trade according to the assigned settings.

On **Settings &gt; Strategies &gt; Strategy Configurator** you can view and modify strategy presets, or create your own custom strategies.

{% hint style="info" %}
Make sure to read up on [Gunbot strategies](../../trading-strategy-options/about-gunbot-strategies/) before you start trading.

On the strategy pages you can find detailed explanations for each buy and sell method, as well as documentation for all available strategy parameters.
