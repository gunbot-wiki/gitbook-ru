# Swap exchanges

{% hint style="success" %}
All Gunbot license types can use an API slot system, this allows you to update your keys anytime or switch between different supported exchanges at no extra costs.
{% endhint %}

## Register a new API key

On the **Swap Exchanges** page you can see how many API slots your license has, and enter up to this number of API keys to be registered for use.

To register a new key, follow these steps:

* Make sure the Gunbot core is running, without errors, on an already registered API key
* Go to the **Swap Exchanges** page, select the exchange, enter your key and save the changes.
* Refresh the page in case you don't see the form to update your keys.

After registering a key, you can use it as Master Key in your exchange settings.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you regularly switch between exchange accounts, it's easiest to leave your exchange API details in the exchange section for every exchange you plan to use.

Then when you want to switch, just copy the master key from there and enter it on the Swap Licensed exchanges page.
{% endhint %}



## Update an existing key

You can also use the **Swap Exchanges** page to update an already registered key for one of your exchange accounts. Just use the steps described above and overwrite the old key.
